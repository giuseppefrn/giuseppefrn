ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @giuseppefrn

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science, I've been working on Deep Learning for different tasks such as Anomaly Detection and Colour Specification. 
I'm always ready to learn something new to me, and I have a passion for Data Engineering. Indeed, I'm taking courses and playing with different Data Engineering tools. 

At the moment I live in The Netherlands, and I'm looking forward to starting my career here!
